	<p>VisRseq, is a framework for analysis of sequencing datasets that provides a computationally rich and accessible framework for integrative and interactive analyses without requiring programming expertise.</p>
	<p align="middle"> <img src="/images/Interface.png" width="800"> <p>
	
	<h2>Features</h2>

	<h3>R Apps</h3>
	<p>Offering a semi-auto generated and unified graphical user interface for computational packages in R and repositories such as Bioconductor. </p>

	<h3>Interactive Apps</h3>
	<p>To address the interactivity limitation inherent in R libraries, our framework include several native apps that provide exploration and brushing operations as well as an integrated genome browser. The apps can be chained together to create more powerful analysis workflows.</p>

	<h3>Data manipulation</h3>
	<p>Creating data tables and processing sequencing data into data columns.</p>

	<h3>Computations on data columns</h3>
	<p>Using an excel or R syntax</p>
